Implementing NoDB in action

This project is based on the research paper ‘NoDB in Action: Adaptive Query
Processing on Raw Data by ​ Ioannis Alagiannis, Renata Borovica, Miguel Branco,
Stratos Idreos, Anastasia Ailamaki’. The aim of NoDB is to minimize querying time for
large files by reducing the need to load data by constructing adaptive indices on it.

Our project is a standalone implementation that demonstrates the efficacy of creating
indices while reading data from csv files.
